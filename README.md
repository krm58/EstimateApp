# Estimate_App
Uses Kivy to create a multi-platform (Android, iOS, Linux, Mac, Windows) application that allows workers to make lists of materials and tools with estimated prices for each item, then creates a formatted word document presenting the list in a table format. Also allows the user to email this document to multiple clients and supervisors. This app was intended to be used for plumbers when writing Estimates on a job site, but this is a general-purpose list-making app with email capabilities. 

#### Requires a companylogo.png file in the directory (input by the user) so the word document can insert a picture of the company's logo.
